# Unofficial Official NetNewsWire Themes Directory

This is a theme directory for the [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) RSS reader.

To install a theme you have to download the zip, unpack it and import it to NetNewsWire by either double-clicking it on macOS, sharing it to NetNewsWire on iOS or using the `+` button on iOS.
NetNewsWire has an URL scheme for this but GitHub [strips non-http URL schemes](https://github.community/t/deeplink-urls-are-stripped-from-github-markdown/199464).
The install URL is included as text, you can copy it and open it your browser.
